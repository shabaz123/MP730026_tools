## ble-multimeter-app
Used to provide remote access to the MP730026 multimeter display

To use, click here --> [ble-multimeter-app](https://shabaz123.github.io/MP730026_tools/ble-multimeter-app/)

If you're on Android and wish to optionally install the app, click on the Install pop-up that appears when you go to that page. If the pop-up does not appear, then click on the top-right **three-dots menu** in Android Chrome, and then select **Install App** in the drop-down menu.

Please check each range makes sense before relying on the app! I’m not liable for any issues, the code is for free with no guarantee, and is intended for engineers, to evaluate themselves.

***NOTE*** It is preferable to use Chrome, or perhaps Chrome-based browsers! It ***may*** run on other browsers. The reason is, it uses the web Bluetooth LE API, which is not supported on all web browsers.

In particular, the Bluetooth LE API doesn't seem to be supported on Appe mobile devices (iPhone and iPad). However, there is a good workaround for Apple mobile products. The solution is to download an alternative browser from the Apple mobile store, called [WebBLE](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webble/id1193531073) . That supports the Bluetooth LE API. It costs $1.99. To use it, launch that app, and then tap near the top of the page in order to bring up an address bar. Then, it behaves like a normal web browser and you can click on the same link as mentioned earlier, i.e.:
